# 12-Week Software Engineering Mastery Plan with Checkboxes

This 12-week intensive plan is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced software engineering practices, building a strong portfolio along the way. It assumes basic programming knowledge (e.g., Python or Java). If you're a complete beginner, dedicate Week 1 to a crash course like Codecademy's Python track. Aim for 10-15 hours/week, split into readings, exercises, projects, and reviews. Use free resources (e.g., Coursera, edX, YouTube's freeCodeCamp) and track progress in a journal or Notion page.

Check off tasks, mini-projects, and milestones as you complete them to easily track what's next. In GitHub, these will render as interactive checkboxes.

## Plan Overview
- **Readings/Lectures**: Books, articles, or online courses.
- **Exercises**: Coding problems (LeetCode, HackerRank, Exercism).
- **Projects**: Build and deploy apps; use GitHub for version control and portfolio.
- **Reviews**: Weekly reflections on lessons, challenges, and code quality.
